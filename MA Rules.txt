# Magical Athlete Rules

## Game Overview

Magical Athlete is a roll and move game about racer wacky characters around a track. Just roll a die, move your racer, and try to finish first. But all the racers have wacky, game changing abilities. Like the Magician, who gets to re-roll dice, or Legs, who can literally just aways move 5 instead of rolling. Race four times with a different racer each time. Whoever has the most points after four races wins.

## Components

* 2 racetrack boards
	* Mild: An oval of 30 spaces with a second corner at space 15
	* Wild: An oval of 30 spaces with the second corner at space 15 and special spaces:
		* Space 1: Racer gets one bronze chip
		* Space 5: Racer trips
		* Space 7: Racer moves +3 spaces
		* Space 11: Racer moves +1
		* Space 13: Racer gets one bronze chip
		* Space 16: Racer moves -4 spaces
		* Space 17: Racer trips
		* Space 23: Racer moves +2
		* Space 24: Racer moves -2
		* Space 26: Racer trips
* 30 racers
* 30 racer cards
* 6 dice
* 20 point chips
	* 4 gold
	* 4 silver
	* 12 bronze
* 1 rulebook

## Setup

1. Put the selected racetrack in the middle of the table
2. The shuffled racer deck
3. Dump out the racer bag nearby
4. Put the gold and silver point chips next to the finish line
5. Keep the bronze point chips somewhere handy
6. Give everyone a die

## Recruitment

To start, everyone drafts a team of 4 racers.

Put out cards from the racer deck equal to double the number of players. So if you have 4 players, put out a set of 8 racer cards face up.

Choose a start player and going clockwise, each player is going to draft a racer. When the last player picks a racer, repeat this process but in reverse: the last player in turn order now drafts first, and the draft goes counterclockwise until everyone has 2 racers from this set.

That's right, it's a snake draft!

Repeat this process again, starting with the player to the left of whoever drafted first last time. Everyone should have 4 cards now, and you're ready to race!

## Prepare to race

Everyone picks a racer card from their hand and reveals it at the same time.

Everyone takes their racer token from the pile and puts it into onto the starting space of the track.

## Race

The start player goes first. They roll their die and move that many spaces on the track. That's called your main roll and move. That term is important, since a lot of abilities trigger off of that move specifically. If any powers trigger, resolve them when they happen.

If there's a question about order of operations, it always goes in this order:
1. Powers triggered by die rolls: Current player, board, other racers in turn order (clockwise around the table)
2. Current player powers: Current player, board, other racers in turn order (clockwise around the table)
2. Any racetrack powers
3. Other player powers, in turn order (clockwise around the table)

After a player finishes their turn, the next player goes in clockwise order. Repeat, until 2 racers cross the finish line, ending the race!

## End of race

Immediately as the second racer crosses the finish line, the race ends!

The winner takes a gold chip from the pile. The runnerup takes a silver chip.

Then everyone:
1. Discards that racer card and token
2. Chooses a new racer and simultaneously reveals it
3. Gets their new racer token and the next race begins!

Whoever finished farthest behind in the previous becomes the start player. If there's a tie, the player with the fewest points goes is the start player. If there's still a tie, roll off!

## Final scoring

When the fourth race is over, the game ends. Whoever has the most points wins!

If there's a tie, there's a tie.

# Defined Terms

* **Main Move:** The recurring action you get on your turn, where you roll your die and Move that many spaces.

* **Move:** When a racer changes spaces from powers that specifically use the word "Move."

	* If a racer ever needs to "Move 0," that does **not** count as moving for the purposes of triggering other powers based on movement.

* **Passing:** When a racer starts a Move behind a racer and ends the same Move ahead of them.

* **Space:** The squares between the starting area and the finish line. The starting Space (Space 0) counts as a Space! Anything past the finish line doesn't.

* **Stopping on a Space:** Racers are Stopped on a Space after they've finished Moving onto it, or otherwise arriving there by other means, like in the case of the Flip Flop Warping.

* **Sharing a Space:** Racers Share a Space when both are currently Stopped on that Space—unlike a Space they might temporarily occupy in the course of Moving, Warping, etc.

* **Lead racer:** The racer(s) currently closest to the finish line. This doesn't count racers who have already crossed the finish line.

* **Last place racer:** The racer(s) currently closest to the starting area.

* **Trip:** Tripped racers skip their Main Move. To remember that a racer Tripped, lay them down on their current Space, then on their turn, put them back upright to indicate they've recovered.

	* Tripped racers can still take actions and have their actions triggered.

* **Behind and Ahead:** Racers are Behind another racer if they are Stopped on a Space closer to the starting area. They're Ahead of a racer if they're Stopped on a Space closer to the finish line. If they Share a Space with a racer, they're neither Behind nor Ahead of them.

* **Warp:** When a racer Warps it is placed on the Space it Warped to. Warping does **not** count as Moving.

* **Swap:** When a racer Swaps Spaces with another player, the two racers immediately exchange Spaces. Swapping does **not** count as Moving.

## Miscellaneous rules clarifications:

* If you reroll for any reason, treat the prior roll as never having happened for the purposes of triggering powers.
* The starting space is a Space!
* Powers that influence multiple racers—like the Party Animal—happen simultaneously. Racers can still trigger powers about stopping on a space if they arrive at the same time.
* Racer powers do not trigger after they win or otherwise leave a race.
* If anything says you can reroll a die, that means the most recent die you've rolled for any reason
* If there's an infinite loop, you only do one cycle of the loop.
* Coach gets +1 to its move even if it isn't on a space with any other character. So it always gets +1 and then if any other racers on a space with Coach, they also get a +1.
